Emerging technologies, shifting customer demands and evolving regulations are likely to result in new service demands.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will be used to automate processes and support faster, more accurate decision-making. This will include automating customer service inquiries and fraud detection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The use of digital platforms and mobile devices will increase. Customers will demand more convenient and engaging experiences across devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be an increased focus on cyber security as organizations work to protect themselves from data theft and other attacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affordable, accessible financial planning and advice services will be in high demand as consumers look for ways to better manage their money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Financial institutions will need to offer innovative payment solutions that cater to the needs of a growing millennial population. This may include mobile wallets, peer-to-peer payments, and cryptocurrency services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Robo-advisors are likely to become more popular as investors look for low-cost, automated investment options.</p>

<h1 id="How-will-artificial-intelligence-impact-the-financial-services-industry-by-2022"><a href="#How-will-artificial-intelligence-impact-the-financial-services-industry-by-2022" class="headerlink" title="How will artificial intelligence impact the financial services industry by 2022?"></a>How will artificial intelligence impact the financial services industry by 2022?</h1><p>The financial services sector is preparing for a future dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). Banks and other institutions are investing in AI to improve customer experience, increase efficiency, and cut costs.</p>
<p>According to a report by PwC, 80% of banks plan to implement AI by 2022. The main reasons for this are the need to improve customer experience and compete with disruptors in the industry.</p>
<p>Major players in the financial services industry are already seeing the benefits of AI. For example, JP Morgan Chase has developed an AI-based virtual assistant named Marquee. Marquee is designed to help customers with tasks such as checking account balances and paying bills.</p>
<p>Other banks are also developing similar applications. HSBC, for example, has developed an AI chatbot called Amy which helps customers with questions about products and services.</p>
<p>AI can also be used to detect fraudulent activity. For example, Wells Fargo has developed an artificial intelligence system called Vision that uses machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions. This has helped Wells Fargo reduce losses from fraud by more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to improving customer experience and reducing fraud, AI can also be used to improve efficiency in the financial services industry. For example, AI can be used to automate processes such as account reconciliation and KYC checks.</p>
<p>AI can also be used to create customized recommendations for products and services. This can help banks improve customer retention and boost revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, AI can help banks reduce costs by automating routine tasks such as data entry and customer service. In fact, PwC estimates that banks could save up to $8 billion per year by implementing AI technologies.</p>

<h1 id="What-will-be-the-major-challenges-faced-by-financial-service-providers-by-2022"><a href="#What-will-be-the-major-challenges-faced-by-financial-service-providers-by-2022" class="headerlink" title="What will be the major challenges faced by financial service providers by 2022?"></a>What will be the major challenges faced by financial service providers by 2022?</h1><p>The next five years will be an exciting time for financial service providers, as they face major challenges and opportunities in the industry. Some of the most pressing issues that financial service providers will need to address by 2022 include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The increasing popularity of online banking and mobile payments. Financial service providers must continue to invest in technology in order to remain competitive and appeal to consumers who are increasingly comfortable conducting transactions online or via their mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The rise of FinTech companies. Financial service providers must brace themselves for competition from innovative FinTech companies, which are quickly gaining a foothold in the industry. These companies are often able to offer more customer-friendly products and services, so it is important for financial service providers to find ways to stay competitive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regulatory changes. Financial service providers must comply with a variety of new regulations that have been introduced in recent years, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). This can be challenging, but it is important for financial service providers to stay up-to-date on the latest regulations in order to avoid penalties and sanctions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The impact of Brexit. The UKâ€™s decision to leave the European Union will have a significant impact on financial service providers operating in Britain and throughout Europe. It is still unclear exactly what changes will take place, but financial service providers must be prepared for a variety of potential scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The growth of digital currencies. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are becoming increasingly popular, and it is likely that this trend will continue in the coming years. Financial service providers must develop strategies for dealing with digital currencies, including how to best incorporate them into their products and services.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="What-new-technologies-will-emerge-in-the-financial-services-industry-by-2022"><a href="#What-new-technologies-will-emerge-in-the-financial-services-industry-by-2022" class="headerlink" title="What new technologies will emerge in the financial services industry by 2022?"></a>What new technologies will emerge in the financial services industry by 2022?</h1><p>The financial services industry is constantly evolving with new technologies emerging every few years. Here are five that are likely to emerge by 2022.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blockchain</li>
</ol>
<p>The blockchain is a distributed database that allows secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. It has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry by making it easier and faster to transfer money, eliminating the need for third-party verification and reducing transaction costs. Several banks are already testing the blockchain for use in payments and settlements.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Robotic process automation is a technology that allows companies to automate routine tasks such as data entry, regulatory compliance checks and customer service enquiries. RPA can help financial institutions improve efficiency, reduce costs and free up staff for more complex tasks. HSBC has already implemented RPA to streamline processes such as customer onboarding and credit card application processing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Cognitive Computing</li>
</ol>
<p>Cognitive computing is a technology that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to enable machines to learn, reason and interact with humans in natural language. It has the potential to transform the financial services industry by helping banks make better decisions, reduce fraud and provide more personalized customer service. IBM is already using cognitive computing to identify fraudulent transactions for HSBC.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet of things is a network of physical objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other. IoT has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry by enabling banks to interact with customers in new ways, such as through connected cars or smart homes. For example, Barclays has partnered with Samsung to create a smartwatch app that allows customers to check their account balance and make payments without having to carry around their bank cards or mobile phone.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Virtual Reality (VR)</li>
</ol>
<p>Virtual reality is a technology that allows users to experience digital environments as if they were real life situations. VR has the potential to change how consumers interact with financial services products and could eventually lead to the development of completely virtual banks. VR could also be used for training purposes, allowing employees to learn about different products and services in a safe environment without any risk of financial loss.</p>
<h1 id="How-will-the-financial-services-industry-change-in-the-next-5-years"><a href="#How-will-the-financial-services-industry-change-in-the-next-5-years" class="headerlink" title="How will the financial services industry change in the next 5 years?"></a>How will the financial services industry change in the next 5 years?</h1><hr>
<p>The financial services industry is preparing for a big change in the next five years. As technology advances and new disruptors enter the scene, traditional banks and financial institutions will need to adapt to stay competitive.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes to the industry will be in the way consumers bank. In the next five years, we can expect to see a shift towards more digital-only banks and away from traditional physical branches. This is due, in part, to the growing popularity of mobile banking apps and the increasing demand for more convenience.</p>
<p>Another trend that will redefine the financial services industry is the rise of fintech startups. These startups are using technology to offer innovative solutions to traditional banking problems. For example, they are developing new ways to make lending and borrowing money easier and more affordable. Fintech startups are also working on new ways to improve investment strategies and manage portfolio risk.</p>
<p>As fintech continues to grow, we can expect to see even more disruption in the financial services industry. Banks and other traditional institutions will need to find ways to work with these startups if they want to stay competitive. They may also need to invest in their own digital offerings in order to keep up with consumer demand.</p>
<p>The next five years are going to be an exciting time for the financial services industry!</p>
