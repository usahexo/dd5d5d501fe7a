        <h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Hopes-For-Playoff-Berth"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Hopes-For-Playoff-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Hopes For Playoff Berth"></a>Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Hopes For Playoff Berth</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays’ outfield line, consisting of left fielder Steve Pearce, center fielder Kevin Pillar and right fielder Teoscar Hernandez, symbolizes the team’s hopes for a postseason berth.</p>
<p>Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins stated, “We feel like we have as good of an outfield as anyone in baseball.” The trio has exhibited its defensive prowess early in the season.</p>
<p>Pillar and Hernandez teamed up to make a sensational catch against the Baltimore Orioles on April 8th. Pearce has also excelled at the plate, batting .313 with 2 home runs and 9 RBIs.</p>
<p>The strong play of the outfielders has given the Blue Jays a chance to compete in one of the most competitive divisions in baseball. With sluggers such as José Bautista and Josh Donaldson in the lineup, Toronto is hoping to make a return trip to the playoffs after missing out last year.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Struggles-This-Season"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Struggles-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Struggles This Season"></a>Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Struggles This Season</h1><p>Toronto Blue Jays’ line up has had its struggles this season. Outfielder Kevin Pillar has been batting in the lead-off spot for most of the season, and is one of the few players on the team with an OPS above .700. Heading into Wednesday’s game against the Detroit Tigers, Pillar was hitting just .253.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for Toronto this season has been their lack of power hitting. The team is currently ranked 27th out of 30 teams in home runs and slugging percentage. Edwin Encarnacion, who led the team in homers last year with 42, has hit just six this season.</p>
<p>Manager John Gibbons is looking to make some changes to the line-up in order to try and inject some life into the offence. He has been playing outfielder Steve Pearce more recently, and is considering moving him up to the third spot in the batting order. Pearce is hitting .297 with a .901 OPS this season.</p>
<p>“We’re still looking for that guy that can get us going,” Gibbons said. “We’ve talked about a few things, some different guys we could move around.”</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will hope to get on track offensively as they head into a crucial stretch of games. They are currently six games back of first place in the American League East, but only three games out of a wild card spot.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Strong-Pitching"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Strong-Pitching" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Strong Pitching"></a>Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Strong Pitching</h1><p>Although the Toronto Blue Jays have the worst record in baseball, they are still a tough opponent. This is demonstrated by their league-leading line of .264/.332/.439. The high batting average is a result of their strong pitching.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays’ staff ERA of 3.61 is good for sixth in the MLB. Their starters have an ERA of 3.48, which ranks fifth in the league. The back end of the bullpen has also been strong, with an ERA of 3.09, which ranks tenth in MLB.</p>
<p>Despite having a poor record, the Toronto Blue Jays are still a force to be reckoned with on the mound.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Unpredictable-Offense"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-Unpredictable-Offense" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Unpredictable Offense"></a>Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies Unpredictable Offense</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays have an inconsistent offense. In the span of a week, they pile up 16 runs against the Baltimore Orioles, then only muster up two runs in three games against the Tampa Bay Rays. The inconsistency shown by the Blue Jays at the plate is best exemplified by their lineup card.</p>
<p>Manager John Gibbons constantly tweaks his batting order, looking for that right combination to ignite the team’s offense. The latest example was inserting catcher Luke Maile into the number two spot in the order on Saturday. Maile responded by going 2 for 4 with a home run and three RBIs in a victory over the Rays.</p>
<p>“It just kinda changes things up,” Gibbons said of his ever-changing lineup before Saturday’s game. “You get comfortable with somebody in there, you kinda want to leave them there. But sometimes it just doesn’t work out that way.”</p>
<p>That could be said about the entire Blue Jays’ lineup which is filled with volatile hitters. The top of the order features Josh Donaldson and Kendrys Morales who can carry the team on any given night, but they are also capable of going 0 for 4. Similarly, Justin Smoak and Yangervis Solarte provide some much-needed protection for sluggers Donaldson and Morales, but they are also streaky hitters.</p>
<p>The bottom third of the order is often where Gibbons tinkers most with his lineup since there is less pressure to produce offensively. Against the Rays on Saturday, Maile was slotted in as the number six hitter while Darwin Barney batted seventh and Devon Travis eighth. That alignment paid dividends with Travis and Maile both contributing big hits in Toronto’s 7-2 win over Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will need that type of balanced production throughout their lineup if they hope to make a playoff run this season. Their inconsistent offense has been one of the main reasons why they find themselves 10 games back of first place in the American League East Division standings.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-More-Of-The-Same"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays’-Line-Signifies-More-Of-The-Same" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies More Of The Same"></a>Toronto Blue Jays’ Line Signifies More Of The Same</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays are looking to rebound this season after a disappointing 2017 campaign. This offseason they made a few big moves in order to improve their ballclub. They acquired Curtis Granderson, Yangervis Solarte, and Randal Grichuk via trade, and signed OF Aledmys Diaz. The additions should help the offense which finished near the bottom of the league in runs scored last season.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays also made some smaller tweaks to their roster, most notably signing OF Steve Pearce to platoon with Devon Travis at second base. Pearce had a breakout season in 2017, hitting .288 with 23 home runs and 84 RBI. He provides much-needed power to the lineup and will likely be a key contributor in the team’s success or failure this season.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays’ lineup is largely unchanged from last year and it looks like more of the same for Toronto. They will again rely on their powerful offense to carry them to victory, but that may not be enough this season. The pitching staff is still a question mark and there are several teams in the AL East that look to be better than them.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the Blue Jays have talent and can be playoff contenders if everything goes right. But with so many other teams in the division improving over the offseason, it’s going to be tough for them to make it back to the postseason. I expect them to finish somewhere around third place in the AL East this year.</p>
