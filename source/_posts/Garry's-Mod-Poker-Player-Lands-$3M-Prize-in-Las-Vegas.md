#  Garry's Mod Poker Player Lands $3M Prize in Las Vegas

Garry's Mod, also known as GMod, is a sandbox physics game created by Garry Newman in 2004. The game allows players to manipulate objects in a 3D environment and insert models into the game using the Valve Source Engine.

One of the most popular activities in Garry's Mod is playing poker. In fact, there are several dedicated poker servers that host regularly scheduled tournaments. On July 23, 2017, one of these tournaments was won by a player known as "Raptor Jesus" for a prize of $3 million.

Raptor Jesus is from the United States and has been playing Garry's Mod poker for about two years. He is considered to be one of the best players in the world, and his victory at the Las Vegas tournament was his first major win. When asked about his success, Raptor Jesus said "I just play my own game and don't worry about anyone else. I'm not sure what my secret is, but it seems to be working."

The $3 million prize is the largest ever awarded in a Garry's Mod poker tournament. It is also the second largest online gaming prize ever awarded, surpassed only by last year's World Series of Poker Main Event champion, Scott Blumstein.

Garry Newman was quick to congratulate Raptor Jesus on his victory. "This just goes to show that anything can happen in GMod poker," he said. "It's a really fun game and I'm glad so many people are enjoying it."
