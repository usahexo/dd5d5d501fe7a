#  Casino mogul Phil Ruffin eyes up Godfather slot machine

Casino mogul and business magnate Phil Ruffin is eyeing up a new investment – the $1.5 million Godfather slot machine.

The gaming machine, which was unveiled at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas last week, has already caught Ruffin’s attention. He says he is keen to get his hands on one for one of his casinos.

“We are always looking for new games and interesting games and this looks like it could be one,” Ruffin told Reuters.

The Vegas-based businessman is no stranger to high stakes gambling; in 2008 he won £746 million (around $1.2 billion) when he took on British casino magnate Andy Beal in a heads-up poker game.

Ruffin isn’t the only one who sees dollar signs in the new slot machine; industry experts are predicting that the game will be a big hit with casino goers.

“There is certainly a lot of interest in it,” Frank Legato, editor of gambling industry magazine Gambling Insider, told Reuters. “The Godfather brand has a lot of equity. It should do well.”

The new slot machine is based on Francis Ford Coppola’s classic 1972 mafia movie and allows players to take on the role of Michael Corleone as they try to make their way up the ladder of the criminal underworld.

It includes mini games such as bombing rival businesses and recruiting henchmen as well as traditional slots gameplay. Players can also win prizes such as cars and vacations by lining up symbols from the movie on the five reels.

#  Billionaire casino owner eyes up lucrative Godfather slot machine market

Having made his fortune in the casino industry, it is no surprise that billionaire owner of the world's largest gambling empire is looking to expand into new markets. The Godfather slot machine market is seen as particularly lucrative, with experts estimating that it could be worth up to $10 billion.

The move would see the casino owner go head-to-head with industry giants such as International Game Technology (IGT) and Aristocrat Technologies, both of which have a strong presence in the market. So far, the casino owner has been tight-lipped about his plans, but it is believed that he is eyeing up several potential acquisitions.

One thing is for sure; with such a large sum at stake, competition between the major players is set to be fierce.

#  Casino mogul Phil Ruffin in talks to buy Godfather slot machine patent

Casino mogul Phil Ruffin is in talks to buy the patent for the iconic Godfather slot machine, which was created by the late Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi.

The move could see Ruffin, who owns the Treasure Island resort in Las Vegas, challenge rival casino companies such as MGM and Wynn Resorts in the lucrative slots market.

Ruffin has already made a fortune from his ownership of the Miss America pageant, and he is now said to be looking to invest in new gaming technology.

The Godfather slot machine was first released by Yamauchi's Nintendo in 1995 and it has become one of the most popular - and profitable - games in history.

Nintendo is said to be keen to sell the patent for around $1 billion, but Ruffin is thought to be offering less than that amount.

Other potential buyers include gambling companies like IGT and Aristocrat Leisure, as well as private equity firms.
