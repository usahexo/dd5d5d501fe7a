Henry David Thoreau was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist and naturalist who is best known for his book Walden. He was born in Concord, Massachusetts on July 12, 1817.

After leaving college, Thoreau started working as a teacher but he soon became more interested in writing and nature. In 1845, he published his first book - A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. This was followed by Walden in 1854 - a book which is now considered to be a classic of American literature.
