#  Nevada bucks the trend, remains only state with legal sports betting

Nevada has long been known as a gambling mecca in the United States, and its sports betting scene is no exception. While other states have begun to legalize various forms of sports betting in recent years, Nevada continues to hold a monopoly on the market.

This is due in large part to the state's expansive gambling laws, which have been on the books since the 1930s. These laws allow casinos and racetracks to offer any type of betting imaginable, including sports betting, horseracing, and poker.

This regulatory framework has made Nevada a hot spot for sports betting enthusiasts, and the state's casinos have reaped the rewards. In 2017, Nevada's sportsbooks took in over $500 million in bets, a figure that is more than six times larger than that of any other state.

Not surprisingly, many gaming companies are headquartered in Nevada, including Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Wynn Resorts Limited. These companies have been able to thrive due to the state's liberal gambling laws and strong consumer demand for sports betting.

While other states are beginning to legalize sports betting, Nevada will likely continue to hold a dominant market share for some time. The state's gaming companies are well-positioned to take advantage of this growing industry, and they should continue to see strong profits in the years ahead.

#  Delaware making a killing off of legalized sports betting

As of June 2018, Delaware has raked in over $16 million in revenue from legalized sports betting. This number is only going to go up as other states follow suit and legalize sports betting. The state is making a killing off of this new industry, and there is no signs of this trend slowing down.

So why is Delaware doing so well with sports betting? There are a few reasons. First, the state has a long history of gambling, so people are already familiar with it. Second, the state has been quick to embrace new technologies, such as online betting. And third, the casinos in Delaware are really good at marketing their sports betting options to customers.

Whatever the reason, Delaware is clearly reaping the benefits of legalized sports betting. And other states would be wise to follow its lead.

#  Rhode Island seeing big revenue from sports betting

Rhode Island has been generating a significant amount of money from sports betting, thanks to the legalization of the activity in November.

Since then, the state has generated more than $2 million in revenue from sports betting. That number is expected to grow as the football season kicks into high gear.

Most of that revenue has come from bettors who have put money on professional football games. But Rhode Island officials say they’re seeing a growing interest in betting on college games, as well.

That’s good news for Rhode Island, which is facing a $190 million budget deficit this year. Sports betting is expected to help alleviate some of that shortfall.

In addition to generating revenue, sports betting has also created jobs in the state. More than 100 people are now working at the four casinos in Rhode Island that offer sports betting.

State officials say they plan to use some of the money generated by sports betting to invest in new gaming technology and to promote tourism in Rhode Island.

#  New Jersey's sports betting industry thriving

After the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in May, New Jersey set out to create an industry that would be both compliant with state law and attractive to bettors. The state has succeeded on both fronts, with sportsbooks reporting record gross gaming revenue for July.

The Garden State's first legal sports bet was placed at Monmouth Park Racetrack on June 14, just a few days after the Court's ruling. That day also saw the launch of DraftKings Sportsbook, the first of several NJ-based books to open. By the end of July, there were ten such books operating in the state.

According to figures released last week by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), NJ's casinos and racetracks took in $422 million in sports bets during the month. This marks a whopping 220% increase over July 2017, when only $138 million was wagered.

It's not just that more money is being bet now that it's legal; average wagers are also larger than they were before. In July 2018, gamblers laid down an average of $528 per bet; in July 2017, that number was only $91.

These numbers are good news for New Jersey's casinos and racetracks, which have seen their share of gambling revenue decline in recent years as more and more people have moved to internet and offshore betting sites. The DGE expects sports betting to generate $300 million in gross gaming revenue this year, with that number growing substantially in future years.

Not everyone is happy with New Jersey's success, however. The major professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB – are suing the state, claiming that its new law violates federal law and allows for too much gambling on their games. The case is currently being heard by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia.

#  Montana becomes latest state to legalize sports betting

Montana has become the latest U.S. state to legalize sports betting, following the lead of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi. The new law authorizes the state’s five existing tribal casinos to offer sports betting, with the first bets expected to be placed in mid-May.

Sports betting is a $150 billion industry worldwide, and it is estimated that Americans wager some $60 billion annually on sporting events. In New Jersey, where sports betting has been legal since 2018, over $1 billion has been wagered on sports so far this year.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased crime and corruption in sports. However, many experts believe that regulated and legalized sports betting is actually a safer option than the current black market.

Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will generate much-needed tax revenue for state governments, as well as create jobs in the gaming industry. They also believe that it will be a boon for tourism, as people from all over the country will visit states like Montana to place bets on sporting events.

So far, 32 states have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting, and it is likely that more states will follow suit in the coming years.
