#  Norwich City & Sheffield United Crowned Champions!

Norwich City and Sheffield United have been crowned champions of the English Championship and League One respectively.

Norwich’s title win was confirmed with a 3-1 victory over Aston Villa at Carrow Road, while Sheffield United’s championship success was sealed with a 1-0 win away to Coventry City.

With three games remaining, Norwich are currently nine points clear of second-placed Leeds United, while Sheffield United are five points ahead of nearest challengers Portsmouth.

Norwich will be playing in the Premier League for the first time in their history next season, while Sheffield United return to the top flight after a 12-year absence.

#  Aston Villa all in and out of the Premier League!

Aston Villa were all in and out of the Premier League, as they had two successive promotions to get back to the top-flight, but they could only last one season there before they got relegated again.

Dean Smith’s side came up as runners-up in the Championship and capitalised on Fulham’s relegation, as they made an immediate return to the Premier League. Tammy Abraham was the star man for Villa, as he netted 26 goals in his debut season in England’s second tier.

But Villa never looked like they were at home in the Premier League and their poor form saw them slump down the table. They only won three games all season and that was not enough to keep them up as they finished 20th, just one point above the relegation zone.

Many of their key players left in the summer transfer window and it is going to be interesting to see if Villa can make an immediate return to the Premier League this time around. John McGinn was one of the players who left for Celtic and he will be a big miss for Villa. The midfielder was sensational for Smith’s side last season and he will be hard to replace.

The likes of Tyrone Mings and Jed Steer have already been brought in by Villa and they will hope that these new signings can help them bounce back immediately from their disappointing relegation campaign.

#  Brighton & Hove Albion's Gutsy Gamble Pays Off

Brighton & Hove Albion have every reason to be ecstatic after their improbable surge to Premier League safety.

The Seagulls looked doomed for much of the season, but they pulled off a miraculous escape that would make Ali Baba proud.

Manager Chris Hughton made some gutsy decisions along the way, and his gamble paid off in the end.

He benched top scorer Glenn Murray in favor of young striker Sam Baldock, and that decision ultimately paid dividends.

Murray came off the bench to score a vital goal in Brighton's 3-1 victory over Nottingham Forest, and that was the turning point in their season.

Hughton also gambled on defensive midfielder Dale Stephens, who had been out of favor for most of the season.

Stephens repaid his manager's faith with an outstanding performance in Brighton's crucial 1-0 win over Crystal Palace.

This unlikely team pulled off one of the great escapes in Premier League history, and they deserve all the accolades they will receive.

#  Middlesbrough go down in style, while Derby County make history

Middlesbrough’s relegation from the Championship was confirmed with a whimper on Tuesday night, as they slumped to a 3-0 home defeat to Derby County.

Goals from Matej Vydra, Andreas Weimann and David Nugent handed Derby their first victory at the Riverside Stadium since September 2009, and consigned Middlesbrough to their second successive relegation.

Tony Pulis’ side were abject throughout and never looked likely to get anything out of the game, meaning they will now play in League One next season.

Derby, by contrast, secured their place in the play-offs with the win and will now face Fulham in the semi-finals.

It was an occasion that marked both the end of an era for Middlesbrough and a new chapter in Derby’s history, as Frank Lampard took charge of his first competitive game as manager of the Rams.

#  The final day of the Championship season – dramatic relegation escapes and play-off heartache

The final day of the Championship season saw plenty of drama, with relegation escapes and play-off heartache.

West Brom were relegated after losing 1-0 at home to Crystal Palace, while Stoke City were relegated after a 2-1 defeat at Swansea City.

Meanwhile, Fulham and Cardiff City secured their places in the Premier League following wins over Aston Villa and Wolves, respectively.

In the play-offs, Derby County missed out on promotion after losing to Leeds United in the semi-finals.
