# Why Do Quite A Few Numbers Repeat Themselves on the Roulette Table?

Roulette is a game that has been played around the world for centuries. It is a game of chance that is enjoyed by millions of people, whether it be at a land-based casino or an online one like PokerStars. While the game is simple to play, there are a few things that can be confusing, such as why quite a few numbers tend to repeat themselves on the roulette table. In this article, we will explore some of the reasons behind this phenomenon.

## The Wheel

To understand why certain numbers tend to repeat themselves on the roulette table, we must first look at the wheel. There are two types of roulette wheels: the European wheel and the American wheel. The European wheel has 37 pockets numbered 0-36, while the American wheel has 38 pockets numbered 0-36 and 00. The more pockets a wheel has, the lower your chances of winning. This is why the European wheel is generally preferred by players as it provides better odds.

## The Law of Large Numbers

When it comes to probability, there is something known as the law of large numbers. This law states that as a sample size increases, the average of the results will get closer to the expected value. In the case of roulette, this means that the more you play, the closer the results will get to the expected value of each number being hit a certain percentage of the time.

## Streaks

Another reason why certain numbers tend to repeat themselves on the roulette table is due to streaks. Streaks occur when a certain number hits multiple times in a row. While this may seem unlikely, it is actually not uncommon for a number to hit twice or even three times in a row. This can be attributed to the law of large numbers as well. As the sample size increases, the likelihood of a streak occurring also increases.

## The Gambler's Fallacy

Lastly, the reason why some players may believe that certain numbers tend to repeat themselves on the roulette table is due to the gambler's fallacy. This fallacy is the belief that if a certain event has not occurred in a while, it is more likely to occur in the future. For example, if the number 7 has not been hit in a while, some players may believe that it is due to hit soon. However, in reality, the odds of the number 7 hitting on the next spin are the same as they were on the previous spin.

In conclusion, there are a few reasons why certain numbers tend to repeat themselves on the roulette table. These reasons include the wheel, the law of large numbers, streaks, and the gambler's fallacy. While it may be tempting to believe that certain numbers are due to hit, it is important to remember that roulette is a game of chance and every spin is independent of the previous one. So, the next time you play roulette at PokerStars, keep these factors in mind and enjoy the thrill of the game!
